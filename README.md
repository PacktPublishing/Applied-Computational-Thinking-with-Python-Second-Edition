**Algorithm design for complex real-world problems**

## What is this book about?
Applied Computational Thinking with Python provides a hands-on approach to implementation and associated methodologies that will have you up-and-running, and productive in no time. Developers working with Python will be able to put their knowledge to work with this practical guide using the computational thinking method for problem-solving.

This book covers the following exciting features:

* Find out how to use decomposition to solve problems through visual representation
* Employ pattern generalization and abstraction to design solutions
* Build analytical skills to assess algorithmic solutions
* Use computational thinking with Python for statistical analysis
* Understand the input and output needs for designing algorithmic solutions
* Use computational thinking to solve data processing problems
* Identify errors in logical processing to refine your solution design
* Apply computational thinking in domains, such as cryptography, and machine learning

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:

```
def encrypt(message, key):
  encryptedM = ‘’
  for letts in message:
    if letts in LETTERS:
      num = LETTERS.find(letts)
      num += key
      encryptedM += LETTERS[num]
  return encryptedM
```
